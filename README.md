Insights from Artificial Intelligence Applications in Pesticide Development
drug.csv and Pesticide.csv are the original datasets, run in the reinvent4 environment.
For environmental installations refer toï¼šhttps://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4
The /Molecular_Retrosynthesis/ folder records the results of molecular complexity calculations. For details, refer to: https://github.com/frog2000/Spacial-Score
/Retrosynthesis/ 1.reaction_route_predict/ directory, documenting the results of the first predicted synthetic route (where drug.csv was renamed Chembl_drug.csv).
The results are pooled within /result_data/, the reaction_route.csv file records the aggregated results of the reaction route predictions. The drug and pest directories, record the datasets of the drug as well as the pesticide cuts, and output.json records the results of the reaction route predictions.
The /price_predict/2.gen_mol/ directory records the result records of the generated models.
/New_Molecules/ folder for newly generated drug/pesticide molecules and their property predictions respectively.
/TSNE/ folder records chemical distribution of drug/pesticide molecules.
